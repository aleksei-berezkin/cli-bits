# cli-bits

A collection of scripts for everyday use.

## Setup

- Clone the repo.
- Make sure `node` is available in your shell.
- Add `./bin` to your `PATH`, e.g. by editing `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`.

## Compatibility

The utilities are written primarily for macOS, but many should also work on Linux. The JS scripts may also run on Windows, though they havenâ€™t been tested there.

## Usage

See the comments in each script in `./bin`.
